# ex-marketo

Keboola Connection docker app for extracting data from specific endpoints of Marketo REST API.


##Functionality


##Intro
This component allows KBC to get data from a few endpoints of the Marketo REST API (http://developers.marketo.com/rest-api/). 
It relies heavily on package marketorestpython (https://github.com/jepcastelein/marketo-rest-python).

As of now, the component can be used for extracting data from 6 endpoints, but it can be easily extended.
